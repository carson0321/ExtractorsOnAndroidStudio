Dear Ms Rivera

Greetings
 hope this email finds you well


I have just received the Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange for my J1
Visa
 However I noticed that there is an error on the document


Its states that I will be enrolled in the Department of Economics
 which is
incorrect
  I am supposed to be a Visiting Graduate in the *Department of
Electrical Engineering*


How should I proceed now
  Will this error effect the Visa Application
process
 Or will I be needing a corrected form
 Since it's already the end
of June
 is it possible for the resend to be fast-tracked
 as I will only
have about only month left only for the visa application and interview
process after the re-sending of the corrected document


Thanks in advance for your help
 I have attached a photo below of the
incorrect document


Best Regards

Terence Ting-Wei Liu
