i see alot of nationalism bias on the internet 
i dunno 
wait 
and it should be nationalistic bias 
so a little too much 
but I think this might not be i the original text 
It all boils down to the nationalism bias  or Chinese superiority complex  which should be avoided in humanities courses 
i think you can use both 
very good 
much better

coz in South Africa that would be quite rare 
Is that like normal

Hey I gotta a question so do the TW studentspeople like all hangout together in the states
